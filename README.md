# My Portfolio Website

## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio repository!

This is a modern, responsive portfolio website i built for myself, as a software developer with a games computing background. The site features a sleek, glassmorphic design with dynamic theme switching, animated project displays, and an expandable interface that showcases technical skills and project work. Fully responsive for any media device for clear reading.

## Why no framework ? 

I chose vanilla JavaScript for my portfolio because it's fundamentally a static site with simple interactions. Adding React would introduce 40-50KB of overhead for functionality I can achieve in 2-12KB of vanilla JS. It demonstrates that I understand the performance implications of my architectural decisions and can distinguish between when frameworks add value versus when they're unnecessary complexity. For my other projects, I used React because they had complex state management requirements that justified the framework
